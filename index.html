There are also balloons that have special properties that affect the game in different ways. It's a simple and casual game, but it has challenging game modes too. It also has a global leaderboard.

				<i> Puzzle-adventure game played on browser. </i>
				</div> 
				<p style="margin-top:10%">
				Doggy Lock-Go! was developed for a 48-hours long Game Jam. The player can "lock" the boxes together. When locked, moving one of the boxes also moves the other one. The objective is reaching the end of the level. The game has multiple levels. Though it did not win a prize, it was generally received well and was praised in the comments for its unique mechanic, clever level design and challenging learning curve.

					Project Sharp

				<i> Turn based strategy game played on browser. </i>

				<p style="margin-top:10%">
				Project Sharp is a strategy game where the player reacts to enemy attacks by choosing an appropriate skill. There are more than 15 distinct skills. Each skill requires a combination of different resources, which are "Focus", "Strength" and "Stability". Skill costs change depending on the enemy action. For example, blocking an enemy doing a heavy attack may require more strength than blocking an enemy doing a swift attack. The players also gain items that can add new skills, modify existing skills or give the player utility actions. There are 5 distinct enemy types with different behaviours, so the player must constantly come up with different strategies to survive and defeat them.

				Farm Runner is a runner game where you collect eggs while avoiding lightning clouds and hungry wolves. Each egg adds another chicken to your flock.

				</h2>
				<div style="margin-bottom: 32px; text-align:center">

				<p style="margin-top:10%">
				Gun Simulator is a game where the player micro-manages the gun controls instead of just clicking a button to shoot or reload. For example, to reload the basic pistol you need to tilt the gun sideways, eject the magazine, put in a new magazine, then tilt the gun the other way and rack the slider. There are 3 unique guns with different mechanics. It has an endless survival mode against robots and a drill mode where the player tries to pass various drills in the shortest time possible.

					Next-Level XOX
				</h2>
				<div style="margin-bottom: 32px; text-align:center">
				<i> Multiplayer strategy mobile game. </i>

				<p style="margin-top:10%">
				Next-Level XOX is a 2-player online game. The multiplayer feature is at proof-of-concept level, and it supports only 1 host and 1 client at any given moment. It was a project to test out the features of Photon Multiplayer. The game also has additional rules on top of the classic tic-tac-toe. Pieces have a hierarchy between them, and a stronger piece can be placed on top of a weaker piece. There are also additional rules to balance out this feature, like not being able to put a strong piece directly on an empty tile. These rules make the game infinitely more complex than classic tic-tac-toe.
